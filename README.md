This is a repository for the Holberton School team project "C - Binary Trees".

Learning Objectives:

* What is a binary tree.
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists.
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree.
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree.
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.

Below is a list of all tasks of the project:

0. New node - "Write a function that creates a binary tree node".
1. Insert left - "Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node".
2. Insert right - "Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node".
3. Delete - "Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree".
4. Is leaf - "Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf".
5. Is root - "Write a function that checks if a given node is a root".
6. Pre-order traversal - "Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal".
7. In-order traversal - "Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal".
8. Post-order traversal - "Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal".
9. Height - "Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree".
10. Depth - "Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree".
11. Size - "Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree".
12. Leaves - "Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree".
13. Nodes - "Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree".
14. Balance factor - "Write a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree".
15. Is full - "Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full".
16. Is perfect - "Write a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect".
17. Sibling - "Write a function that finds the sibling of a node".
18. Uncle - "Write a function that finds the uncle of a node".
